# What is Cloud Computing Cloud Computing might seem a big concept when we first get to know about it. According to the definition from National Institute of Standard and Technology of U.S Department of Commerce, Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Cloud Computing has five essential characteristics: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and measured service. It comes in three service models which we will discuss about later: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Its deployment has four models: private cloud, community cloud, public cloud and hybrid cloud [1]. 

# History of Cloud Computing As what we know from today, cloud computing is generally a concept based upon the Internet. Although there is no certain origin for the cloud computing concept, it is generally considered that 1969 ARPANET, the prototype of Internet, should be the beginning of cloud. In late 1970s, the term "client-server" came into use, during when the compute model there clients access data and applications from a central server over a local area network is defined. The concept of Virtual Machine appeared in 1970s. In 1995, pictures of clouds start showing up in network diagrams. The cloud denoted anything too complicated for non-technical people to understand. In 1999, we witnessed the launch of pioneer in cloud computing service,

  At the same time of launching of salesforce, Google is launched in 1999, became an impressive search engine since then. The real cloud computing services was launched by by Amazon in 2006, named Amazon Web Services (AWS), which gave users a brand new way to store data offsite and rent computing service online.  Also an important device was introduced to public in 2007, which was iPhone 1st generation. In 2008, the concept of private cloud emerges, viewed by enterprises as a more secure version of the public cloud. As an innovative company, Google was working on their online services as well. All Google Apps, including Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar and Hangouts are browser-based applications. In 2010,OpenStack was born, sponsored by NASA, powered by Python. It is now considered as one the most popular cloud computing infrastructure now. Combining the products I mentioned above, cloud computing infrastructure, cloud application and cloud computing platform form the three main layers of cloud computing .

# Cloud Computing - Deployment Models As is mentioned above, the cloud computing infrastructure has four deployment models: private cloud, community cloud, public cloud and hybrid cloud. 

**Pirvate Cloud: **It is also known as internal cloud; the platform for cloud computing is implemented on a cloud-based secure environment that is safeguarded by a firewall which is under the governance of the IT department that belongs to the particular corporate. Private cloud as it permits only the authorized users, gives the organisation greater and direct control over their data. Example: SAIT O: Drive and H: Drive. **Community Cloud: **The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns. For example, a cloud used by government and health care institution will share information on citizens. **Public Cloud: ** The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. For example, Google applications. **Hybrid Cloud: **The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability[1]. Next time we will look into more of the service models (SaaS, PaaS and IaaS), and their famous vendors.
