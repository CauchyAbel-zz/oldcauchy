As we discussed earlier in the [Introduction of Cloud Computing][1], we discussed about the four layer architecture of Cloud Computing technology: hardware, infrastructure, platform and application. This leads to the three service models: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS. SaaS (Software as a Service): In this service model, vendors usually provide software to clients. Software will be running on the platform provided by vendor and client only have access to using the software. Most popular SaaS include Google Apps, Salesforce and other online office suite. PaaS (Platfrom as Service): In this service model, service providers will have ready-made environment for software developer to deploy their applications. The main point for PaaS is that it saves developers a lot of time of building the environment, instead, they can put more effort on development and leave the rest to vendors. IaaS (Infrastrcture as Service): Infrastructure as a Service may be the cloud service with longest history. Usually it is presented by providers as web hosting or VPS service. It gives people more choice on the software and hardware that they need. 
## Microsoft Azure - My First Java Web App As one of the most popular cloud computing platform, Microsoft Azure provides both PaaS and IaaS. On Azure, it is very convenient to create a VM in a few steps. Also, Azure can be easily connected with Visual Studio, which allows developer to deploy their applications easily to server. However, today we are going to introduce the deployment of Java Web App on Azure. To deploy your first Java web app onto Azure platform, we will need a Microsoft account, Filezilla FTP Client. Also you will need an already made Java web app, I believe everyone should have on at hand (Unfortunately no Java EE at the moment!!). First we will register for the Microsoft Azure service, get all the free stuff from Microsoft! Follow the steps from: 

<a href="https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index" target="_blank">Azure Account</a>. After the registration, use the new credential to login at <a href="http://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure Portal</a>, you will see a screen like below: [caption id="attachment_78" align="aligncenter" width="945"]<img class="size-large wp-image-78" src="http://cauchyabel.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QQ截图20160214155153-1024x355.png" alt="Azure Portal" width="945" height="328" /> Azure Portal[/caption] The menu on the left makes it very easy for user to manage all his resources belong to different categories. Also, all the applications that are currently deployed in the system is available from the dashboard section in the middle. Next we will create a new web app on Azure. In the portal page menu, we choose "+New" -> "Web+Mobile" -> "Web App". In the basic configuration of the application, give the application a unique name, and "appname.azurewebsites.net" will become the entrance of your web app. In the App Service plan / location, we will choose a data center that is close to us, make it US West. Then we just click on "Create" to create the application. After a few seconds, you should be able to see the application appear on the dashboard. Choose the application, you will see a screen like below: [caption id="attachment_86" align="aligncenter" width="898"]<img class="size-full wp-image-86" src="http://cauchyabel.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QQ截图20160215215735.png" alt="Azure Web App settings" width="898" height="716" /> Azure Web App settings page[/caption] On this page, we need to use the FTP/Deployment username as our login account to our FTP server later, and we also need the FTP hostname ready for the FTP connection as well. But now we are going to set up our Java environment first. Choose "Application settings" in "General" section in the "Settings" menu. In the applications menu, choose Java version as Java 8 (depending on the version of your web app). Leave everything else as default (Web container should be Newest Tomcat 8.0), save the setting. Now if you go to the web app url, you should find that the page will say: "This Java based web application has been successfully created". As the environment is all set, we will launch our FTP client - FileZilla. In the host field, paste the FTP hostname on the web app settings page,  FTP/Deployment username as the username for FTP, and password should be password of your account. Accept the security certificate information. After we are connected, go to the "site-wwwroot-webapps" folder. Here is the directory that you can place your Java web app war file. For creating a war file, refer "[how-can-i-create-a-war-file-of-my-project-in-netbeans][2]". Now we can just drop off any java web app war file in the folder, the Tomcat server will decompress the project automatically. To run an app with a name "sample", in the address bar, type in "yourazurewebappname.azurewebsites.net/sample", you can see your app running! Next time we will look into the deployment of web application on AWS platform, stay tuned!
